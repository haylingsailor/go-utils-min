# go-utils
A collection of packages providing low level utilities for use in multiple
projects.

This version of go-utils was forked from elasticlic, and supports els-cli.

## Packages

**datetime** - includes NowTimeProvider - use this rather than time.Now() in
your apps to make it easy to control time in tests. (E.g. when you want to
check that a value generated from the time is correct.)


Consult the README.md in each package for further details.
